# AGBI-Digital-HealthTech-Grand-Challenge
The objective is to provide a virtual medical assistant. We will be using the technology of Virtual Reality to achieve the objective. The application built will have two main sections: one for the people in medical field i.e. the doctors, health workers, medical students, para-medical staff etc., the other section will be for the Patients or common people. The Patients section will have a 3D Virtual guide which will help the patients to analyse their symptoms and also prepare a health chart/report on the basis of the questions answered by the user. Unlike the normal chatbots, we will provide the use of voice to communicate so that it is easier to use. The section for the people of medical field will also have a virtual guide to interact which will save the data provided by the doctors for a particular patient. There will be a section for training as well. In the time of this pandemic, it is not possible to learn practically sitting at home. The application will have a virtual room, tools, virtual patients describing their problems to see if the learner can handle it well.
